# Substrate Rustdocs

Reference level documentation for Substrate generated by [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html).

## Release Process

The docs in this repository are typically published automatically by CI jobs, but it has occasionally been necessary to
make manual adjustments. Here is the process for publishing a new version.

* Clone the main [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/) repository.
* Checkout the tag whose docs you wish to publish.
* Run `cargo +nightly doc --no-deps --workspace --all-features --open`.
  Use the absolute path to your local copy of _this_ project to replace `<path_to_this_repo>`.
* Move (and override if existing) the generated docs from `./target/doc` to the appropriately named folder in this repo.
* Add an `index.html` to the folder you just copied in by duplicating one from a previous version.
* Update the repo's main `index.html` to point to the newly published version.
* After pushing to the remote master branch, tag the commit with the following:

  ```bash
  git tag <tagged-version>
  # example:
  # git tag v3.0.0+monthly-2021-07

  git push origin <tagged-version>
  # example:
  # git push origin v3.0.0+monthly-2021-07
  ```

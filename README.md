# Substrate Rustdocs

Reference level documentation for Substrate generated by [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html).

## Publishing Process

The docs in this repopository are typically published automatically by CI jobs, but it has occasionally been necessary to make manual adjustments. Here is the process for publishing a new version.

* Clone the main [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/) repository.
* Checkout the tag whose docs you wish to publish.
* Run `cargo doc`
* Move the generated docs from `./target/doc` to the appropriately named folder in this repo.
* Add an `index.html` to the folder you just copied in by duplicating one from a previous version.
* Optional: update the repo's main `index.html` to point to the newly published version.
